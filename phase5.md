## Lesson 1: Introduction to Subqueries

### What is a Subquery?
A subquery is a query inside another query. Think of it as asking a question to get information needed to answer a bigger question.

### 1.1 Simple Subquery in WHERE
```sql
-- Find employees earning more than the average salary
SELECT name, salary 
FROM employees 
WHERE salary > (SELECT AVG(salary) FROM employees);
```

**How it works:**
1. Inner query calculates: `(SELECT AVG(salary) FROM employees)` â†’ 57889
2. Outer query becomes: `WHERE salary > 57889`

**Result:**
| name        | salary |
|-------------|--------|
| Mike Wilson | 75000  |
| Lisa Brown  | 60000  |
| Bob Green   | 70000  |

### 1.2 Subquery in SELECT
```sql
-- Show each employee's salary and how it compares to company average
SELECT 
    name, 
    salary,
    (SELECT AVG(salary) FROM employees) as company_avg,
    salary - (SELECT AVG(salary) FROM employees) as difference
FROM employees;
```

### 1.3 Subquery with IN
```sql
-- Find employees working in departments located in Mumbai or Delhi
SELECT name, dept_id 
FROM employees 
WHERE dept_id IN (
    SELECT dept_id 
    FROM departments 
    WHERE location IN ('Mumbai', 'Delhi')
);
```

### Practice Time! ðŸŽ¯
1. Find employees older than the average age
2. Find employees in the department with the highest budget
3. Show employee names and their salary difference from department average

**Answers:**
```sql
-- 1.
SELECT name, age FROM employees 
WHERE age > (SELECT AVG(age) FROM employees);

-- 2.
SELECT name FROM employees 
WHERE dept_id = (SELECT dept_id FROM departments ORDER BY budget DESC LIMIT 1);

-- 3.
SELECT 
    e.name, 
    e.salary,
    e.salary - dept_avg.avg_sal as difference
FROM employees e
INNER JOIN (
    SELECT dept_id, AVG(salary) as avg_sal 
    FROM employees 
    GROUP BY dept_id
) dept_avg ON e.dept_id = dept_avg.dept_id;
```

---

## Lesson 2: Correlated Subqueries

### What Makes it "Correlated"?
The inner query references columns from the outer query. It runs once for each row of the outer query.

### 2.1 Basic Correlated Subquery
```sql
-- Find employees earning more than their department average
SELECT 
    name, 
    salary, 
    dept_id
FROM employees e1
WHERE salary > (
    SELECT AVG(salary) 
    FROM employees e2 
    WHERE e2.dept_id = e1.dept_id  -- This makes it correlated!
);
```

**How it works:**
- For each employee (e1), calculate the average salary in their department (e2)
- Compare their salary to their department average

### 2.2 Correlated Subquery with EXISTS
```sql
-- Find employees who have made sales
SELECT name 
FROM employees e
WHERE EXISTS (
    SELECT 1 
    FROM sales s 
    WHERE s.emp_id = e.emp_id
);
```
**Result:**
| name        |
|-------------|
| John Smith  |
| Mike Wilson |
| Tom Davis   |
| Kate Black  |

### 2.3 NOT EXISTS
```sql
-- Find employees who have NOT made any sales
SELECT name 
FROM employees e
WHERE NOT EXISTS (
    SELECT 1 
    FROM sales s 
    WHERE s.emp_id = e.emp_id
);
```

---

## Lesson 3: Subqueries in FROM Clause (Derived Tables)

### 3.1 Basic Derived Table
```sql
-- Department statistics as a derived table
SELECT 
    dept_stats.dept_name,
    dept_stats.avg_salary,
    dept_stats.emp_count
FROM (
    SELECT 
        d.dept_name,
        AVG(e.salary) as avg_salary,
        COUNT(e.emp_id) as emp_count
    FROM departments d
    LEFT JOIN employees e ON d.dept_id = e.dept_id
    GROUP BY d.dept_id, d.dept_name
) dept_stats
WHERE dept_stats.emp_count > 2;
```

### 3.2 Ranking with Derived Tables
```sql
-- Find the 2nd highest paid employee
SELECT name, salary 
FROM (
    SELECT name, salary,
           ROW_NUMBER() OVER (ORDER BY salary DESC) as salary_rank
    FROM employees
) ranked_employees
WHERE salary_rank = 2;
```

---

## Lesson 4: Window Functions - The Power Tools

### What are Window Functions?
Window functions perform calculations across related rows without collapsing the result into groups.

### 4.1 ROW_NUMBER()
```sql
-- Assign row numbers based on salary ranking
SELECT 
    name, 
    salary,
    ROW_NUMBER() OVER (ORDER BY salary DESC) as salary_rank
FROM employees;
```
**Result:**
| name        | salary | salary_rank |
|-------------|--------|-------------|
| Mike Wilson | 75000  | 1           |
| Bob Green   | 70000  | 2           |
| Lisa Brown  | 60000  | 3           |
| Tom Davis   | 55000  | 4           |
| Kate Black  | 52000  | 5           |

### 4.2 RANK() and DENSE_RANK()
```sql
-- Compare RANK vs DENSE_RANK with ties
SELECT 
    name, 
    salary,
    RANK() OVER (ORDER BY salary DESC) as rank_with_gaps,
    DENSE_RANK() OVER (ORDER BY salary DESC) as dense_rank
FROM employees;
```

**Difference:**
- **RANK():** Skips numbers after ties (1, 2, 2, 4, 5)
- **DENSE_RANK():** No gaps after ties (1, 2, 2, 3, 4)

### 4.3 PARTITION BY - Window Functions by Group
```sql
-- Rank employees within each department
SELECT 
    name, 
    dept_id,
    salary,
    RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY dept_id ORDER BY salary DESC) as dept_rank
FROM employees;
```
**Result:**
| name        | dept_id | salary | dept_rank |
|-------------|---------|--------|-----------|
| Mike Wilson | 1       | 75000  | 1         |
| Tom Davis   | 1       | 55000  | 2         |
| Kate Black  | 1       | 52000  | 3         |
| John Smith  | 1       | 50000  | 4         |
| Lisa Brown  | 2       | 60000  | 1         |
| Sam Brown   | 2       | 47000  | 2         |
| Sarah Jones | 2       | 45000  | 3         |

### 4.4 Other Useful Window Functions
```sql
-- Advanced window functions
SELECT 
    name, 
    salary,
    LAG(salary) OVER (ORDER BY salary) as prev_salary,
    LEAD(salary) OVER (ORDER BY salary) as next_salary,
    SUM(salary) OVER (ORDER BY salary) as running_total
FROM employees
ORDER BY salary;
```

## Lesson 5: Common Table Expressions (CTEs)

### What are CTEs?
CTEs make complex queries readable by breaking them into logical steps.

### 5.1 Basic CTE Syntax
```sql
-- Department averages using CTE
WITH dept_averages AS (
    SELECT 
        dept_id,
        AVG(salary) as avg_salary,
        COUNT(*) as emp_count
    FROM employees
    GROUP BY dept_id
)
SELECT 
    d.dept_name,
    da.avg_salary,
    da.emp_count
FROM dept_averages da
INNER JOIN departments d ON da.dept_id = d.dept_id
WHERE da.avg_salary > 50000;
```

### 5.2 Multiple CTEs
```sql
-- Complex analysis with multiple CTEs
WITH 
high_performers AS (
    SELECT emp_id, name, salary
    FROM employees 
    WHERE salary > (SELECT AVG(salary) FROM employees)
),
dept_stats AS (
    SELECT 
        dept_id,
        AVG(salary) as avg_salary
    FROM employees
    GROUP BY dept_id
)
SELECT 
    hp.name,
    hp.salary,
    d.dept_name,
    ds.avg_salary as dept_avg
FROM high_performers hp
INNER JOIN employees e ON hp.emp_id = e.emp_id
INNER JOIN departments d ON e.dept_id = d.dept_id
INNER JOIN dept_stats ds ON e.dept_id = ds.dept_id;
```

### 5.3 Recursive CTEs (Advanced)
```sql
-- Organization hierarchy (find all reports under a manager)
WITH RECURSIVE org_chart AS (
    -- Base case: top-level managers
    SELECT emp_id, name, manager_id, 1 as level
    FROM employees 
    WHERE manager_id IS NULL
    
    UNION ALL
    
    -- Recursive case: their reports
    SELECT e.emp_id, e.name, e.manager_id, oc.level + 1
    FROM employees e
    INNER JOIN org_chart oc ON e.manager_id = oc.emp_id
)
SELECT name, level FROM org_chart ORDER BY level, name;
```

---

## Lesson 6: Advanced Subquery Patterns

### 6.1 ANY and ALL Operators
```sql
-- Find employees earning more than ANY employee in Finance
SELECT name, salary 
FROM employees 
WHERE salary > ANY (
    SELECT salary 
    FROM employees e
    INNER JOIN departments d ON e.dept_id = d.dept_id
    WHERE d.dept_name = 'Finance'
);

-- Find employees earning more than ALL employees in Finance
SELECT name, salary 
FROM employees 
WHERE salary > ALL (
    SELECT salary 
    FROM employees e
    INNER JOIN departments d ON e.dept_id = d.dept_id
    WHERE d.dept_name = 'Finance'
);
```

### 6.2 Subqueries for Complex Filtering
```sql
-- Find departments where all employees earn above company average
SELECT d.dept_name 
FROM departments d
WHERE NOT EXISTS (
    SELECT 1 
    FROM employees e 
    WHERE e.dept_id = d.dept_id 
    AND e.salary <= (SELECT AVG(salary) FROM employees)
);
```

### 6.3 Top N per Group using Subqueries
```sql
-- Find top 2 highest paid employees in each department
SELECT name, dept_id, salary
FROM (
    SELECT 
        name, 
        dept_id, 
        salary,
        ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY dept_id ORDER BY salary DESC) as rn
    FROM employees
) ranked
WHERE rn <= 2;
```

## Lesson 7: Real Interview Problem Patterns

### Pattern 1: "Find Second Highest" Problems
**Very common in placements!**

```sql
-- Method 1: Using subquery
SELECT MAX(salary) as second_highest
FROM employees 
WHERE salary < (SELECT MAX(salary) FROM employees);

-- Method 2: Using window functions (better)
SELECT DISTINCT salary as second_highest
FROM (
    SELECT salary, 
           DENSE_RANK() OVER (ORDER BY salary DESC) as salary_rank
    FROM employees
) ranked
WHERE salary_rank = 2;
```

### Pattern 2: "Above Average in Their Group"
```sql
-- Employees earning above their department average
SELECT 
    e.name,
    e.salary,
    d.dept_name
FROM employees e
INNER JOIN departments d ON e.dept_id = d.dept_id
WHERE e.salary > (
    SELECT AVG(e2.salary)
    FROM employees e2 
    WHERE e2.dept_id = e.dept_id
);
```

### Pattern 3: "Growth/Trend Analysis"
```sql
-- Monthly sales growth comparison
WITH monthly_sales AS (
    SELECT 
        DATE_FORMAT(sale_date, '%Y-%m') as month,
        SUM(amount) as total_sales
    FROM sales
    GROUP BY DATE_FORMAT(sale_date, '%Y-%m')
)
SELECT 
    month,
    total_sales,
    LAG(total_sales) OVER (ORDER BY month) as prev_month_sales,
    total_sales - LAG(total_sales) OVER (ORDER BY month) as growth
FROM monthly_sales;
```

    name, 
    salary,
    ROW_NUMBER() OVER (ORDER BY salary DESC) as row_num,
    RANK() OVER (ORDER BY salary DESC) as rank_val,
    DENSE_RANK() OVER (ORDER BY salary DESC) as dense_rank,
    PERCENT_RANK() OVER (ORDER BY salary DESC) as percent_rank
FROM employees;
```

### 8.2 Aggregate Window Functions
```sql
-- Running totals and moving averages
SELECT 
    name,
    salary,
    SUM(salary) OVER (ORDER BY emp_id) as running_total,
    AVG(salary) OVER (ORDER BY emp_id ROWS BETWEEN 2 PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW) as moving_avg_3
FROM employees;
```

### 8.3 Practical Business Analytics
```sql
-- Sales performance with rankings and comparisons
SELECT 
    e.name,
    s.amount,
    s.sale_date,
    -- Rank within all sales
    RANK() OVER (ORDER BY s.amount DESC) as overall_rank,
    -- Rank within their department
    RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY e.dept_id ORDER BY s.amount DESC) as dept_rank,
    -- Compare to previous sale by same employee
    LAG(s.amount) OVER (PARTITION BY s.emp_id ORDER BY s.sale_date) as prev_sale,
    -- Running total of employee's sales
    SUM(s.amount) OVER (PARTITION BY s.emp_id ORDER BY s.sale_date) as emp_running_total
FROM sales s
INNER JOIN employees e ON s.emp_id = e.emp_id;
```

## Lesson 9: Advanced CTE Patterns

### 9.1 CTE for Complex Calculations
```sql
-- Employee performance scorecard
WITH 
employee_stats AS (
    SELECT 
        e.emp_id,
        e.name,
        e.salary,
        COUNT(s.sale_id) as total_sales,
        COALESCE(SUM(s.amount), 0) as total_revenue
    FROM employees e
    LEFT JOIN sales s ON e.emp_id = s.emp_id
    GROUP BY e.emp_id, e.name, e.salary
),
performance_metrics AS (
    SELECT 
        *,
        CASE 
            WHEN total_revenue > 30000 THEN 'High'
            WHEN total_revenue > 15000 THEN 'Medium'
            ELSE 'Low'
        END as performance_tier
    FROM employee_stats
)
SELECT 
    name,
    salary,
    total_sales,
    total_revenue,
    performance_tier
FROM performance_metrics
ORDER BY total_revenue DESC;
```

### 9.2 CTE for Data Quality Analysis
```sql
-- Find data inconsistencies
WITH 
salary_analysis AS (
    SELECT 
        dept_id,
        AVG(salary) as avg_dept_salary,
        MIN(salary) as min_dept_salary,
        MAX(salary) as max_dept_salary
    FROM employees
    GROUP BY dept_id
)
SELECT 
    e.name,
    e.salary,
    d.dept_name,
    sa.avg_dept_salary,
    CASE 
        WHEN e.salary > sa.max_dept_salary * 1.5 THEN 'Potential Outlier'
        WHEN e.salary < sa.min_dept_salary * 0.5 THEN 'Potential Error'
        ELSE 'Normal'
    END as salary_flag
FROM employees e
INNER JOIN departments d ON e.dept_id = d.dept_id
INNER JOIN salary_analysis sa ON e.dept_id = sa.dept_id;
```

## Lesson 11: Interview-Winning Techniques

### Technique 1: Breaking Down Complex Problems
**When faced with a complex question:**
1. **Identify what you need to calculate**
2. **Work backwards from the final result** 
3. **Use CTEs to break into logical steps**
4. **Test each step independently**

### Technique 2: Performance Considerations
```sql
-- Instead of multiple subqueries (slow)
SELECT name 
FROM employees 
WHERE salary > (SELECT AVG(salary) FROM employees)
  AND age > (SELECT AVG(age) FROM employees);

-- Use JOIN with aggregated data (faster)
WITH company_stats AS (
    SELECT AVG(salary) as avg_salary, AVG(age) as avg_age
    FROM employees
)
SELECT e.name 
FROM employees e
CROSS JOIN company_stats cs
WHERE e.salary > cs.avg_salary AND e.age > cs.avg_age;
```

### Technique 3: Handling Edge Cases
```sql
-- Always consider NULL values and empty results
SELECT 
    name,
    COALESCE(
        (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM sales WHERE emp_id = e.emp_id), 
        0
    ) as sales_count
FROM employees e;
```

## Lesson 12: Advanced Window Function Applications

### 12.1 Business Analytics with Windows
```sql
-- Comprehensive sales analytics
SELECT 
    e.name,
    s.sale_date,
    s.amount,
    -- Ranking
    ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY s.emp_id ORDER BY s.sale_date) as sale_sequence,
    RANK() OVER (ORDER BY s.amount DESC) as amount_rank,
    -- Comparisons
    LAG(s.amount) OVER (PARTITION BY s.emp_id ORDER BY s.sale_date) as prev_sale,
    s.amount - LAG(s.amount) OVER (PARTITION BY s.emp_id ORDER BY s.sale_date) as sale_growth,
    -- Aggregates
    SUM(s.amount) OVER (PARTITION BY s.emp_id ORDER BY s.sale_date) as cumulative_sales,
    AVG(s.amount) OVER (PARTITION BY s.emp_id) as emp_avg_sale
FROM sales s
INNER JOIN employees e ON s.emp_id = e.emp_id
ORDER BY e.name, s.sale_date;
```

### 12.2 Percentiles and Distribution
```sql
-- Salary distribution analysis
SELECT 
    name,
    salary,
    NTILE(4) OVER (ORDER BY salary) as salary_quartile,
    PERCENT_RANK() OVER (ORDER BY salary) as salary_percentile,
    CUME_DIST() OVER (ORDER BY salary) as cumulative_distribution
FROM employees;
```

## Common Interview Questions & Expert Solutions

### Question 1: "Consecutive Records Problem"
**"Find employees with consecutive sales on consecutive days"**

```sql
WITH daily_sales AS (
    SELECT 
        emp_id,
        sale_date,
        ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY emp_id ORDER BY sale_date) as rn,
        DATE_SUB(sale_date, INTERVAL ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY emp_id ORDER BY sale_date) DAY) as group_date
    FROM sales
),
consecutive_groups AS (
    SELECT 
        emp_id,
        group_date,
        COUNT(*) as consecutive_days
    FROM daily_sales
    GROUP BY emp_id, group_date
    HAVING COUNT(*) >= 2
)
SELECT DISTINCT e.name
FROM consecutive_groups cg
INNER JOIN employees e ON cg.emp_id = e.emp_id;
```

### Question 2: "Department Comparison Analysis"
**"Find departments performing better than company average in both salary and sales"**

```sql
WITH 
dept_performance AS (
    SELECT 
        d.dept_id,
        d.dept_name,
        AVG(e.salary) as avg_salary,
        COALESCE(AVG(s.amount), 0) as avg_sale
    FROM departments d

## Phase 5 Final Assessment Problems

### Problem Set A: Core Concepts (Must Solve All)

**A1. Multi-level Subquery Challenge**
```sql
-- Find employees whose salary is above their department average 
-- AND above the overall company average
SELECT 
    e.name,
    e.salary,
    d.dept_name
FROM employees e
INNER JOIN departments d ON e.dept_id = d.dept_id
WHERE e.salary > (SELECT AVG(salary) FROM employees)  -- Company avg
  AND e.salary > (  -- Department avg
    SELECT AVG(salary) 
    FROM employees e2 
    WHERE e2.dept_id = e.dept_id
  );
```

**A2. Complex EXISTS Pattern**
```sql
-- Find departments that have employees in ALL age groups (20s, 30s, 40s)
SELECT d.dept_name
FROM departments d
WHERE EXISTS (
    SELECT 1 FROM employees e1 
    WHERE e1.dept_id = d.dept_id AND e1.age BETWEEN 20 AND 29
)
AND EXISTS (
    SELECT 1 FROM employees e2 
    WHERE e2.dept_id = d.dept_id AND e2.age BETWEEN 30 AND 39
)
AND EXISTS (
    SELECT 1 FROM employees e3 
    WHERE e3.dept_id = d.dept_id AND e3.age BETWEEN 40 AND 49
);
```

**A3. Advanced Window Function**
```sql
-- For each employee, show their sales rank within department 
-- and identify if they're in top 50% of their department
WITH sales_by_emp AS (
    SELECT 
        e.emp_id,
        e.name,
        e.dept_id,
        COALESCE(SUM(s.amount), 0) as total_sales
    FROM employees e
    LEFT JOIN sales s ON e.emp_id = s.emp_id
    GROUP BY e.emp_id, e.name, e.dept_id
)
SELECT 
    name,
    total_sales,
    RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY dept_id ORDER BY total_sales DESC) as dept_rank,
    COUNT(*) OVER (PARTITION BY dept_id) as dept_size,
    CASE 
        WHEN RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY dept_id ORDER BY total_sales DESC) <= 
             COUNT(*) OVER (PARTITION BY dept_id) / 2.0 
        THEN 'Top 50%'
        ELSE 'Bottom 50%'
    END as performance_tier
FROM sales_by_emp;
```

### Problem Set B: Interview Simulation (Time: 20 minutes each)

**B1. Classic "Nth Highest" Variation**
```sql
-- Find the 3rd highest salary in each department
WITH dept_salary_ranks AS (
    SELECT 
        name,
        salary,
        dept_id,
        DENSE_RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY dept_id ORDER BY salary DESC) as salary_rank
    FROM employees
)
SELECT 
    d.dept_name,
    dsr.name,
    dsr.salary
FROM dept_salary_ranks dsr
INNER JOIN departments d ON dsr.dept_id = d.dept_id
WHERE dsr.salary_rank = 3;
```

**B2. Growth Analysis Problem**
```sql
-- Find employees whose sales show consistent growth (each sale > previous sale)
WITH employee_sales_ordered AS (
    SELECT 
        s.emp_id,
        s.amount,
        s.sale_date,
        LAG(s.amount) OVER (PARTITION BY s.emp_id ORDER BY s.sale_date) as prev_amount
    FROM sales s
),
growth_check AS (
    SELECT 
        emp_id,
        COUNT(*) as total_sales,
        SUM(CASE WHEN amount > COALESCE(prev_amount, 0) THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) as growth_sales
    FROM employee_sales_ordered
    GROUP BY emp_id
)
SELECT e.name
FROM growth_check gc
INNER JOIN employees e ON gc.emp_id = e.emp_id
WHERE gc.total_sales > 1 
  AND gc.growth_sales = gc.total_sales - 1;  -- All sales except first show growth
```

### Problem Set C: Advanced Patterns (Company-Specific)

**C1. Hierarchical Data (Microsoft/Amazon Style)**
```sql
-- Find all employees and their management chain depth
WITH RECURSIVE mgmt_chain AS (
    -- Base: Top-level managers
    SELECT emp_id, name, manager_id, 0 as chain_depth
    FROM employees 
    WHERE manager_id IS NULL
    
    UNION ALL
    
    -- Recursive: Add subordinates
    SELECT e.emp_id, e.name, e.manager_id, mc.chain_depth + 1
    FROM employees e
    INNER JOIN mgmt_chain mc ON e.manager_id = mc.emp_id
)
SELECT 
    name,
    chain_depth,
    CASE 
        WHEN chain_depth = 0 THEN 'CEO/Director'
        WHEN chain_depth = 1 THEN 'Department Head'
        WHEN chain_depth = 2 THEN 'Team Lead'
        ELSE 'Individual Contributor'
    END as hierarchy_level
FROM mgmt_chain
ORDER BY chain_depth, name;
```

**C2. Complex Business Logic (TCS/Infosys Style)**
```sql
-- Employee Performance Scorecard with multiple criteria
WITH 
performance_metrics AS (
    SELECT 
        e.emp_id,
        e.name,
        e.dept_id,
        e.salary,
        EXTRACT(YEAR FROM CURRENT_DATE) - EXTRACT(YEAR FROM e.hire_date) as tenure_years,
        COALESCE(COUNT(s.sale_id), 0) as sales_count,
        COALESCE(SUM(s.amount), 0) as total_revenue
    FROM employees e
    LEFT JOIN sales s ON e.emp_id = s.emp_id
    GROUP BY e.emp_id, e.name, e.dept_id, e.salary, e.hire_date
),
department_benchmarks AS (
    SELECT 
        dept_id,
        AVG(salary) as dept_avg_salary,
        AVG(total_revenue) as dept_avg_revenue
    FROM performance_metrics
    GROUP BY dept_id
),
scoring AS (
    SELECT 
        pm.*,
        db.dept_avg_salary,
        db.dept_avg_revenue,
        -- Scoring logic
        CASE WHEN pm.salary >= db.dept_avg_salary THEN 25 ELSE 0 END +
        CASE WHEN pm.total_revenue >= db.dept_avg_revenue THEN 25 ELSE 0 END +
        CASE WHEN pm.tenure_years >= 3 THEN 25 ELSE 0 END +
        CASE WHEN pm.sales_count >= 2 THEN 25 ELSE 0 END as performance_score
    FROM performance_metrics pm
    INNER JOIN department_benchmarks db ON pm.dept_id = db.dept_id
)
SELECT 
    name,
    performance_score,
    CASE 
        WHEN performance_score >= 75 THEN 'Outstanding'
        WHEN performance_score >= 50 THEN 'Good'
        WHEN performance_score >= 25 THEN 'Average'
        ELSE 'Needs Improvement'
    END as performance_rating
FROM scoring
ORDER BY performance_score DESC;
```
