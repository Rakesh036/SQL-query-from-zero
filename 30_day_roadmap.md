# ðŸ”‘ Tips During Practice

1. **Write queries yourself** â€” donâ€™t just read.
2. **Try multiple approaches** (JOIN vs subquery vs CTE).
3. **Debug carefully** â€” use `LIMIT` + check intermediate results.
4. **Think in English first** â†’ convert to SQL step by step.
5. **Simulate interview pressure** â€” give yourself **5â€“10 min max** per query in the last week.

ðŸ‘‰ If you follow this 30-day plan, youâ€™ll not only finish **200 SQL problems** but also build a **strong mental framework** to solve any unseen SQL question in interviews.
