Perfect ‚úÖ This is the **right way to practice** ‚Äî start with 50 structured problems (foundation), then move to the next 50 (intermediate + advanced).

I‚Äôll first give you:

1. **Tables (schema + sample rows)**
2. **50 basic SQL problems** grouped by topic

Later, I‚Äôll give you the **next 50** for joins, subqueries, window functions, and advanced cases.
